\description{
Convenience function for fitting community occupancy models (defined in a commOccu object) in JAGS or Nimble.
}
\details{
Models will be fit either in JAGS or Nimble, depending on the decision made in the \code{nimble} argument in \code{\link{communityModel}}.

For Nimble, compilation is strongly recommended for long model runs. Uncompiled models can run extremely slow. Compilation itself can take a while also, and requires that Rtools is available on the system.

This is a convenience function only which hides some of the configuration options. If you require more control over model fitting, you can run all steps individually. See vignette 5 for details.
