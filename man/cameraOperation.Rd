\arguments{
\item{CTtable}{data.frame containing information about location and trapping
period of camera trap stations}

\item{stationCol}{character. name of the column specifying Station ID in
\code{CTtable}}

\item{cameraCol}{character. name of the column specifying Camera ID in
\code{CTtable} (optional). If empty, 1 camera per station is assumed.}

\item{sessionCol}{character. name of the column specifying session ID in
\code{CTtable} (optional). Use it for creating multi-session / multi-season
detection histories (unmarked: \code{\link[unmarked]{unmarkedMultFrame}};
secr: \code{\link[secr]{capthist}} )}

\item{setupCol}{character. name of the column containing camera setup dates
in \code{CTtable}}

\item{retrievalCol}{character. name of the column containing camera
retrieval dates in \code{CTtable}}

\item{hasProblems}{logical. If TRUE, function will look for columns
specifying malfunction periods in \code{CTtable} (naming convention:
\code{ProblemX_from} and \code{ProblemX_to}, where X is a number)}

\item{byCamera}{logical. If TRUE, camera operation matrix is computed by
camera, not by station (requires \code{cameraCol})}

\item{allCamsOn}{logical. Takes effect only if \code{cameraCol} is defined
and if \code{byCamera} is FALSE. If \code{allCamsOn = TRUE}, all cameras at
a station need to be operational for the station to be operational (e.g. 1
camera out of 2 malfunctioning renders the station inoperational). Output
values can be 1/0/NA only (all cameras at a station operational/ at least 1
camera not operational/ no camera set up). If \code{allCamsOn = FALSE}, at
least 1 active camera makes a station operational.}

\item{camerasIndependent}{logical. Return number of active camera traps by
station? Only if \code{byCamera} is FALSE and \code{allCamsOn} is FALSE. If
\code{camerasIndependent} is TRUE, output values will be the number of
operational cameras at a station. If \code{camerasIndependent} is FALSE, the
value is 1 if at least 1 camera was operational, otherwise 0. In both cases,
values are NA if no camera was set up.}

\item{dateFormat}{character. The format of columns \code{setupCol} and
\code{retrievalCol} (and potential problem columns) in \code{CTtable}. Must
be interpretable by either \code{as.Date} or the "orders" argument
\code{\link[lubridate]{parse_date_time}} in \pkg{lubridate}. Can be a date
or (since version 2.1) a date-time.}

\item{occasionStartTime}{integer. time of day (the full hour) at which to
begin occasions. Replaces \code{occasionStartTime} from
\code{\link{detectionHistory}} and \code{\link{spatialDetectionHistory}}.}

\item{writecsv}{logical. Should the camera operation matrix be saved as a
.csv?}

\item{outDir}{character. Directory into which csv is saved}
}
\value{
A matrix. Row names always indicate Station IDs. If
\code{sessionCol} and/or \code{cameraCol} are defined, they are contained in
the row names also (camera ID only if \code{byCamera = TRUE}). Column names
are dates. \cr Legend: NA: camera(s) not set up, 0: camera(s) not
operational, 1 (or higher): number of operational camera(s) or an indicator
for whether the station was operational (depending on
\code{camerasIndependent} and \code{allCamsOn})
}
\description{
Construct a matrix of daily camera trap station operation for use in
\code{\link{detectionHistory}} and \code{\link{spatialDetectionHistory}},
where it is needed for calculating trapping effort per occasion. It is also
used in \code{\link{surveyReport}} to calculate the number of trap nights
durig a survey. If several cameras were deployed per station, the matrix can
contain camera- or station-specific trap operation information, or
information about sessions during repeated surveys.
}
\details{
\code{cameraCol} is NULL by default, meaning the function assumes there was
1 camera per station in \code{CTtable}. If more than 1 camera was deployed
per station, \code{cameraCol} needs to be specified to identify individual
cameras within a station. Likewise, \code{sessionCol} can be used to if
camera trap stations were operated during multiple sessions / trapping
seasons.

\code{dateFormat} defaults to "YYYY-MM-DD", e.g. "2014-10-31", but can be
any other date format or date-time also. It can be specified either in the
format required by \code{\link[base]{strptime}} or the 'orders' argument in
\code{\link[lubridate]{parse_date_time}} in \pkg{lubridate}. In the example
above, "YYYY-MM-DD" would be specified as "\%Y-\%m-\%d" in base R or "ymd"
in \pkg{lubridate}.

Since version 2.1, dateFormat can be a date-time. That makes it possible to
specify the exact time cameras were set up / retrieved / malfunctioned /
worked again. This information is used to calculate the daily trapping
effort more precisely on days with incomplete effort.

Previously, setup and retrival day were counted as 1, indicating a whole day
of effort on those days. Since version 2.1, setup and retrieval are assumed
to have happened at 12 noon (resulting in daily effort of 0.5 instead of 1).
Users can also specify the exact time cameras were set up (by providing a
date-time in the setup / retrieval / problem columns). See vignette 3 for
more details.

If \code{hasProblems} is TRUE, the function tries to find columns
\code{ProblemX_from} and \code{ProblemX_to} in \code{CTtable}. \code{X} is a
consecutive number from 1 to n, specifying periods in which a camera or
station was not operational. If \code{hasProblems} is FALSE, cameras are
assumed to have been operational uninterruptedly from setup to retrieval
(see \code{\link{camtraps}} for details).

\code{allCamsOn} only has an effect if there was more than 1 camera at a
station. If TRUE, for the station to be considered operational, all cameras
at a station need to be operational. If FALSE, at least 1 active camera
renders the station operational. Argument \code{camerasIndependent} defines
if cameras record animals independently (it thus only has an effect if there
was more than 1 camera at a station). This is the case if an observation at
one camera does not increase the probability for detection at another camera
(cameras face different trails at a distance of one another).
Non-independence occurs if an animal is likely to trigger both camers (as
would be the case with 2 cameras facing each other).

If \code{camerasIndependent} is TRUE, 2 active cameras at a station will
result in a station operation value of 2 in the resulting matrix, i.e., 2
independent trap days at 1 station and day. If \code{camerasIndependent} is
FALSE, 2 active cameras will return value 1, i.e., 1 trap night at 1 station
per day.

Row names depend on the input arguments and contain the station name and
potentially session and camera names (if \code{sessionCol} and/or
\code{cameraCol} are defined).

Naming convention is (since version 1.2) \bold{Bold} information are from
the columns \code{stationCol}, \code{sessionCol} and \code{cameraCol} in
\code{CTtable}:

\bold{Station} \cr \bold{Station}__SESS_\bold{SessionID} \cr
\bold{Station}__CAM_\bold{CameraID} \cr
\bold{Station}__SESS_\bold{SessionID}__CAM_\bold{CameraID}

Session are designated with prefix "__SESS_", cameras with prefix "__CAM_".
Therefore, these are reserved words and may not be part of station, session
or camera names. Here's what it may look like in real life:

\bold{Station1} \cr \bold{Station1}__SESS_\bold{2019} \cr
\bold{Station1}__CAM_\bold{1024152} \cr
\bold{Station1}__SESS_\bold{2019}__CAM_\bold{1024152}

Functions detectionHistory and spatialDetectionHistory recognize these and
use the information accordingly.
}
\note{
Setting \code{camerasIndependent} according to the sampling situation
is important for the functions \code{\link{detectionHistory}} and
\code{\link{spatialDetectionHistory}}, if sampling effort (the number of
active trap nights in a occasion) is to be computed and returned.
