\arguments{
\item{inDir}{character. Directory containing camera trap images sorted into
station subdirectories (e.g. inDir/StationA/)}

\item{IDfrom}{character. Read species ID from image metadata ("metadata") of
from species directory names ("directory")?}

\item{hasCameraFolders}{logical. Do the station subdirectories of
\code{inDir} have camera-subdirectories (e.g. inDir/StationA/CameraA1;
inDir/StationA/CameraA2)?}

\item{metadataSpeciesTag}{character. The species ID tag name in image
metadata (if IDfrom = "metadata").}

\item{metadataHierarchyDelimitor}{character. The character delimiting
hierarchy levels in image metadata tags in field "HierarchicalSubject".
Either "|" or ":".}

\item{removeNames}{logical. remove appended species names?}

\item{writecsv}{logical. write csv table containing old and new file names
into \code{inDir}?}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the old and new file names and
directories.

\description{
Add or remove species names from JPEG image filenames. It makes it easier to
find images of a species.
}
\details{
Species names can be appended or removed from image filenames. Before
running the function, you may want to run
\code{\link{checkSpeciesIdentification}} to detect possible
misidentifications. As an example, the function would change an image file
name from "StationA__2015-05-41__20-59-59(1).JPG" to
"StationA__2015-05-41__20-59-59(1)__Species Name.JPG". If species names were
appended several times by accident, they can all be removed by running the
function with \code{removeNames = TRUE}
}

# copy sample images to another location (so we don't mess around in the package directory)
wd_images_ID <- system.file("pictures/sample_images_species_dir", package = "camtrapR")
file.copy(from = wd_images_ID, to = getwd(), recursive = TRUE)       
wd_images_ID_copy <- file.path(getwd(), "sample_images_species_dir")

# append species names
