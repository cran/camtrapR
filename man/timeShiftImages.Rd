\arguments{
\item{inDir}{character. Name of directory containing station directories
with images}

\item{hasCameraFolders}{logical. Do the station directories in \code{inDir}
have camera subdirectories (e.g. "inDir/StationA/Camera1")?}

\item{timeShiftTable}{data.frame containing information about
station-/camera-specific time shifts.}

\item{stationCol}{character. name of the column specifying Station ID in
\code{timeShiftTable}}

\item{cameraCol}{character. name of the column specifying Camera ID in
\code{timeShiftTable} (optional)}

\item{timeShiftColumn}{character. The name of the column containing time
shift values in \code{timeShiftTable}}

\item{timeShiftSignColumn}{character. The name of the column with the
direction of time shifts in \code{timeShiftTable}. Can only be "-" or "+".}

\item{undo}{logical. Undo changes and restore the original images? Please be
careful, this deletes any edited images if \code{TRUE}}

\item{ignoreMinorErrors}{logical. Ignore minor errors that would cause the
function to fail (set TRUE for images with bad MakerNotes, observed in
Panthera V4 cameras)}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the information about the processed
directories and the number of images.

\description{
Change the values of digital timestamps in image metadata using ExifTool. If
date/time of images were set incorrectly, they can be corrected easily in
batch mode for further analyses. Please, always make a backup of your data
before using this function to avoid data loss or damage. This is because
ExifTool will make a copy of your images and applies the time shifts to the
copies. The file extension of the original images (.JPG) will be renamed to
".JPG_original".
}
\details{
\code{timeShiftTable} is a data frame with columns for station ID, camera ID
(optional), time shift value and direction of time shift (for an example see
\code{\link{timeShiftTable}}). Images in \code{inDir} must be sorted into
station directories. If \code{hasCameraFolders = TRUE}, the function expects
camera subdirectories in the station directories and will only apply time
shifts to the camera subdirectories specified by \code{CameraCol} in
\code{timeShiftTable}. If \code{hasCameraFolders = FALSE}, shifts will be
applied to the whole station directory (including potential subdirectories).

The values of \code{timeShiftColumn} must adhere to the following pattern:
"YYYY:mm:dd HH:MM:SS" ("year:month:day hour:minute:second"). Examples:
"1:0:0 0:0:0" is a shift of exactly 1 year and "0:0:0 12:10:01" 12 hours and
10 minutes and 1 second. Note that stating "00" may cause problems, so use
"0" instead if an entry is zero.

\code{timeShiftSignColumn} signifies the direction of the time shift. "+"
moves image dates into the future (i.e. the image date lagged behind the
actual date) and "-" moves image dates back (if the image dates were ahead
of actual time).

ExifTool stores the original images as \code{.JPG_original} files in the
original file location. By setting \code{undo = TRUE}, any JPG files in the
directories specified by \code{timeShiftTable} will be deleted and the
original JPEGs will be restored from the JPG_original files. Please make a
backup before using \code{undo}.

Years can have 365 or 366 days, and months 28 to 31 days. Here is how the
function handles these (from the exiftool help page): "The ability to shift
dates by Y years, M months, etc, conflicts with the design goal of
maintaining a constant shift for all time values when applying a batch
shift. This is because shifting by 1 month can be equivalent to anything
from 28 to 31 days, and 1 year can be 365 or 366 days, depending on the
starting date. The inconsistency is handled by shifting the first tag found
with the actual specified shift, then calculating the equivalent time
difference in seconds for this shift and applying this difference to
subsequent tags in a batch conversion."

\code{ignoreMinorErrors} is useful if image timestamps are not updated
correctly (entries in column "n_images" of the output are "... files weren't
updated due to errors"). This can be caused by bad MakerNotes and so far was
only observed in Panthera V4 and V6 cameras. In that case, set
\code{ignoreMinorErrors} to \code{TRUE}. This will add the "-m" option to
the Exiftool call, thereby ignoring minor errors and warnings and applying
the time shift nevertheless.
