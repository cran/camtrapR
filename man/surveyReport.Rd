\arguments{
\item{recordTable}{data.frame containing a species record table as given by
\code{\link{recordTable}}}

\item{CTtable}{data.frame containing information about location and trapping
period of camera trap stations (equivalent to \code{\link{camtraps}}}

\item{camOp}{camera operation matrix created with
\code{\link{cameraOperation}}}

\item{speciesCol}{character. name of the column specifying Species ID in
\code{recordTable}}

\item{stationCol}{character. name of the column specifying Station ID in
\code{CTtable} and \code{recordTable}}

\item{cameraCol}{character. name of the column specifying Camera ID in
\code{CTtable} and \code{recordTable}}

\item{setupCol}{character. name of the column containing camera setup dates
in \code{CTtable}}

\item{retrievalCol}{character. name of the column containing camera
retrieval dates in \code{CTtable}}

\item{CTDateFormat}{character. The format of columns \code{setupCol} and
\code{retrievalCol} (and potential problem columns) in \code{CTtable}. Must
be interpretable by either \code{as.Date} or the "orders" argument
\code{\link[lubridate]{parse_date_time}} in \pkg{lubridate}.}

\item{CTHasProblems}{deprecated (since version 2.1)}

\item{recordDateTimeCol}{character. The name of the column containing date
and time of records in \code{recordTable}}

\item{recordDateTimeFormat}{character. The date/time format of column
\code{recordDateTimeCol} in \code{recordTable}.}

\item{Xcol}{character. name of the column specifying x coordinates in
\code{CTtable}. Used to create detection maps if \code{makezip} is TRUE.
(optional)}

\item{Ycol}{character. name of the column specifying y coordinates in
\code{CTtable}. Used to create detection maps if \code{makezip} is TRUE.
(optional)}

\item{sinkpath}{character. The directory into which the survey report is
saved (optional)}

\item{makezip}{logical. Create a zip file containing tables, plots and maps
in \code{sinkpath}?}
}
\value{
An invisible list containing 5 \code{data.frames}.

\item{survey_dates}{station and image date ranges, number of total and
active trap days (calendar days and taking into account independent effort
of multiple cameras, if applicable), number of cameras per station}
\item{species_by_station}{species numbers by station}
\item{events_by_species}{number of events and stations by species}
\item{events_by_station}{number of events for every species by station (only
species that were recorded)} \item{events_by_station2}{number of events for
all species at all stations (including species that were not recorded)}

The output will be saved to a .txt file if \code{sinkpath} is defined.

If \code{makezip} is TRUE, a zip file will be created in \code{sinkpath}. It
contains single-species activity plots, detection maps (if \code{Xcol} and
\code{Ycol} are defined), the survey report tables, the record table and the
camera trap station table, and an example R script.
}
\description{
This function creates a report about a camera trapping survey and species
records. It uses a camera trap station information table and a record table
(generated with \code{\link{recordTable}}) as input. Output tables can be
saved and a zip file for simple data sharing can be created easily.
}
\details{
\code{dateFormat} defaults to "YYYY-MM-DD", e.g. "2014-10-31". It can be
specified either in the format required by \code{\link[base]{strptime}} or
the 'orders' argument in \code{\link[lubridate]{parse_date_time}} in
\pkg{lubridate}. In the example above, "YYYY-MM-DD" would be specified as
"\%Y-\%m-\%d" or "ymd".

\code{recordDateTimeFormat} defaults to the "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
convention, e.g. "2014-09-30 22:59:59". \code{recordDateTimeFormat} can be
interpreted either by base-R via \code{\link[base]{strptime}} or in
\pkg{lubridate} via \code{\link[lubridate]{parse_date_time}} (argument
"orders"). \pkg{lubridate} will be used if there are no "\%" characters in
\code{recordDateTimeFormat}.

For "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS", \code{recordDateTimeFormat} would be either
"\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S" or "ymd HMS". For details on how to specify date
and time formats in R see \code{\link[base]{strptime}} or
\code{\link[lubridate]{parse_date_time}}.

Note: as of version 2.1, argument \code{CTHasProblems} is deprecated and
defunct. Please use \code{camOp} instead to provide information about
periods of camera activity and malfunction. If \code{camOp} is not provided
the legacy version of surveyReport (from camtrapR 2.0.3) will be run with a
warning.
