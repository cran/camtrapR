\usage{
data(recordTableSampleMultiSeason)
}
\description{
Sample multi-season species record table from camera trap images generated from the sample images in the package with the function \code{\link{recordTable}}. Season 2009 is the same as \code{\link{recordTableSample}}, season 2010 was simulated by adding 1 year to these records.
